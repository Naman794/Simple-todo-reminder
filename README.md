# Daily Voice Reminder - Chrome Extension

## üì¢ Description

Daily Voice Reminder is a simple yet effective Chrome extension designed to help you keep track of your tasks and get timely voice notifications. It allows you to manage a general to-do list and set custom-timed reminders for specific tasks, ensuring you stay organized and on top of your schedule. The extension also offers personalized greetings and birthday wishes!

## ‚ú® Features

* **Personalized Setup:** Greet users by name and optionally remember their email and date of birth for birthday greetings. All data is stored locally in the browser.
* **General To-Do List:**
    * Add, manage, and clear general tasks that don't require a specific time alert.
    * Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
    * Visual banner in the popup to indicate active to-do items.
* **Custom-Timed Reminders:**
    * Set reminders for specific tasks at a specific time on the current day.
    * Receive a system notification and a spoken alert when a custom reminder is due.
    * View and delete upcoming custom reminders.
* **Voice Notifications:**
    * Spoken alerts for custom-timed reminders.
    * Optional spoken "Good morning" greeting at 10 AM on weekdays.
    * Optional spoken "Happy Birthday" greeting.
    * Ability to select from available system voices for TTS (Text-to-Speech).
    * Settings to enable/disable voice greetings and spoken reminders.
* **Action Feedback:** Get clear visual feedback (slide-up popups) for actions like adding tasks, setting reminders, or updating settings.
* **Local Data Storage:** All user data (profile, to-dos, reminders, settings) is stored locally using `chrome.storage.local`, ensuring privacy.
* **Clean & User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use and clarity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

* **Manifest V3:** Built using the latest Chrome extension manifest version.
* **Popup UI (`popup.html`, `style.css`, `popup.js`):** The main user interface is an HTML page styled with custom CSS and powered by JavaScript for dynamic interactions, data management, and communication with the background script.
* **Background Service Worker (`background.js`):**
    * Manages alarms using the `chrome.alarms` API for:
        * The 10 AM weekday greeting.
        * Daily birthday checks.
        * Custom-timed reminders set by the user.
    * Handles `chrome.notifications` to display system notifications for custom reminders and birthdays.
    * Uses the `chrome.tts` API to provide spoken feedback and alerts.
* **Local Storage (`chrome.storage.local`):** Securely stores user profile information, to-do lists, custom reminder details, and user preferences directly in the user's browser.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configured in `manifest.json` to enhance security, allowing only necessary resources (like Google Fonts).
